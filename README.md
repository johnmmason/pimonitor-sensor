### Project Overview

Convenience and peace-of-mind are often cited as primary reasons for bringing IOT sensors into the home.  In the past few years, the consumer market has been flooded with a variety of internet-connected home gadgets which aim to make it *as easy as possible* to turn your home into a "smart home".  However, many electronics and computer hobbyists find these products lacking in key areas.  For example,

* Sensor flexibility,
* customization,
* data security,
* and affordability.

This project attempts to address these issues by creating a software framework for inexpensive, homemade Raspberry-Pi based sensor modules and an accompanying self-hosted data logging server.

This project is still early in its development, so its functionality is rather limited.  Currently, the system supports a DHT22 temperature sensor but could be easily modified for other similar sensors.  Please see [johnmmason/pimonitor](https://github.com/johnmmason/pimonitor) for a list of planned additions to the code.
